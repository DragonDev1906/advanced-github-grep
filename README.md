# advanced-github-grep
This Project uses grep.app to filter results before downloading the relevant files and search them using a regex.

## Disclaimer
I do not remember ho exactly I used these files. I most likely used search_old.py with a pattern file initially to experiment, then created utils.py and search.py to automate searches, trying to make the regular expresions morre readable.
